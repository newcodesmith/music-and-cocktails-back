# Music and Cocktails Backend

## Purpose
Continuing my love for music and records, I created this app as a mock monthly record club that features 6 curated albums from different genres with a paired drink. The app allows you to see some info on the album and the paired drink as well as listen to the album on Spotify. In the future I would see the ability to buy the record and maybe a mixed drink package.
